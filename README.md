Analysis of stock market performance for selected green energy sector organizations
## Overview of the Project
A colleague, Steve, just graduated from college with an undergraduate degree in finance. Steve’s parents were very happy about his choice of study as they have been avid investors and hoped he might be able to provide some insights from his financial studies.  Of primary interest to Steve’s parents is the green energy sector, specifically the publicly traded organization DAQO New Energy Corp (Ticker: DQ). As they are singularly invested in the DQ stock, Steve’s parents hoped Steve could use is financial analysis skills to investigate the DQ stock performance. In an effort to help his parents Steve agreed to analyze the DQ stock as well as other stocks in the green energy sector. 

### Purpose of this Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate stock data from the green energy sector.  More specifically the DQ stock performance was analyzed and compared to eleven other stocks in the same sector. 

## Results
After reviewing stock data from 2017 and 2018 the following results were derived. In order to assess stock performance in a given year, two calculations were performed. First, the total volume of stock traded was aggregated across the year. Assuming more transactions of more stock units would be an indicator of higher performance, a higher total volume number was considered higher performing.  The second calculation was the percentage change in stock price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. Reporting percentage change in stock price controls for differences in year start stock prices, providing a relative metric. Higher positive percentage increases were considered higher performing relative to other stocks.
